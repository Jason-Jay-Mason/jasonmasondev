    "body": "Hey Class Dojo! <br/><br/>\nHere's the deal: I care deeply about the impoverished people in our world. Whether it's child slaves mining cobalt in the Congo or a poor single mother in Vietnam struggling to feed her three children in a rundown 200-square-foot apartment, my heart aches for them. I refuse to be willingly ignorant and sit on the sidelines, so It's my personal mission to help in every way I can. This is why I'm applying to work at Class Dojo.<br/><br/>\n\nI believe education is the best way to help people escape poverty and difficult situations. I believe that everyone has something to offer, they just need the right skills and mindset to achieve their potential. Education can make the difference between generational poverty and breaking the cycle of lack. That's why I see working at Class Dojo as an opportunity to collaborate with a company that shares my vision and to be part of a team that lifts up those who need it most. It's an exciting prospect!<br/><br/>\n\nRegarding the Marketing Operations Manager position, I believe my qualifications and skills go beyond what is listed in the requirements, specifically my full-stack web development experience. Let me tell you how that's going to be a game-changer for the Class Dojo team if we work together. <br/><br/>\n\nWhen it comes to a Martech stack that includes tools like Braze, Iterable, Crowdin, and others, ideal implementation and optimization often require in-depth knowledge of server-side APIs and programming methodologies. For example, I noticed that the CD team is working on solving the challenge of implementing multiple languages. If you use Crowdin for translation management, Braze's off-the-shelf integration may not suffice. You may end up resorting to tools like Zapier to try and achieve a no-code approach, which may or may not work as intended. In such cases, basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and templating languages like Liquid is often inadequate, and engineers may be preoccupied with product development. Sound familiar? Trust me, I've seen this before. The good news is that there's a better way, and I'm eager to discuss how I can help.\n<br/><br/>\nCheers,\n"

    "body": "In the past, engineering and marketing functions had little cross-over. But now, with the advent of Martech, huge opportunities are being missed by businesses as a result. The skill set I’ve built as an engineering-minded misfit on marketing teams makes me uniquely qualified to serve businesses in the emerging field of MarTech implementation/development and Marketing Operations.\n\nMy approach to work is guided by the principle of delivering value. Whenever I begin a task, I ask myself: how can I bring more value to the company and its clients? This mindset encourages me to think creatively and motivates me to go above and beyond in my work.\n",
