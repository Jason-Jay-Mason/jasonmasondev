    "body": "Hey Chess.com! Instead of writing the typical cover letter where I go over how qualified I am and talk about how I resonate with the Chess.com values and blah blah blah, I just wanted to get real.<br/<br/>\n\nI love chess. I play it almost every day, and my wife gets mad at me because we have an 8-month-old who demands things. Funny enough, it was her idea to have me apply here. She said, \"How about you apply at Chess.com?\" and I said, \"Amazing idea.\" That was in 2021 when I saw you guys were using Svelte, and I said, \"Awe! I want to learn Svelte so badly, but they probably won't hire me because I don't have a proven track record.\" Que web development montage where I spend the next few years freelancing and getting my chops up, working with referrals from past employers. And now, I can say that I'm pretty proficient at Svelte, and I don’t like freelancing, so I told my wife, \"Alright, it's time to apply at Chess.com.\"<br/<br/>\n\nSo, it was my big moment, and then I realized that you guys are using Vue now, and I said, \"Crap!\" But at this point, and after learning tools like Svelte in about a week, I've realized that it doesn't matter what technology somebody throws at me; I can learn it fast. So I’m applying anyway.<br/<br/>\n\nNow, here's the pertinent question: why should Chess.com give me a shot? I'm certainly not the most seasoned applicant, and I can guarantee that. Nor am I the 170 IQ ex-Google architect GOAT. I'm just a guy who's been the technical-can-do man for marketing teams and business development (as you'll see in my portfolio below). So why should you give me a shot? Well, for one, I use vim. But more importantly, I would be incredibly grateful and feel extremely blessed to be able to work at Chess.com, perfecting a craft that I love (web development).<br/<br/>\n\nGratitude sounds cliché, but I've noticed in my professional career that the people who are the greatest value generators for companies are those who see what they do as more than a career but a craft and are truly grateful that they have a chance to do it every day. And I know 100% I'm bringing that to the table.<br/<br/>\n\nListen, I know you'd be taking a risk on me here, and that's why I'm willing to come work with Chess.com for free for a month. If you don't like me, or you think I'm not capable of delivering substantial value to the company, no worries; we can part ways without hard feelings, and I will be grateful for the opportunity. I hope that mitigates the risk for you and displays my passion for both web development and chess (which, as a side note, I'm super excited to be able to have a legitimate excuse to reach my Elo goals while playing more chess).<br/<br/>\n\nNow, with that type of offer on the table, how can we not set up at least an initial interview?! Thanks for the consideration.<br/<br/>\n\nCheers\n"
