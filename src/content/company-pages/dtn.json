    "body": "Thanks a ton for taking a look at my webume! Let me give you some insights on why I'm applying for the Full Stack Web Developer gig and how I believe I can contribute to DTN. I'm an avid storm chaser on the high plains of Colorado, and when it comes to being in close proximity to dangerous supercells and tornadoes, the right tools can be life-saving. I've been using DTN's RadarScope for years, and it's literally saved my life more than once. It's an incredible product, and as I search for new work, I think it would be pretty cool to work for a company like RadarScope that develops products that help people make informed decisions in their line of work.<br/>\n<br/>\n\n\n Now, let's get to the big question: Why should DTN pick me for the Full Stack Developer role? Firstly, the job description matches my work experience almost perfectly. I mainly build Jamstack websites using Next.js and Sveltekit, and I've been doing user interface and web development for almost ten years now. Plus, if you speak to my references, they'll tell you that I bring passion, integrity, and a strong work ethic to everything I do - something that's not always easy to come by these days. I'm confident that I can bring value to DTN and its customers, and I'm super excited to have a shot at interviewing for this position.<br/>\n<br/>\n\n\nAs an aside, I also wanted to take a moment to talk about my education and why I didn't finish my bachelor's degree at Berklee College of Music. While I was in school, I realized that many undergraduate programs aren't teaching the skills that are relevant in industry, and it seemed like obtaining a degree was easier than ever before. I also considered the amount of debt I would incur and the opportunity cost of spending time memorizing information that wouldn't serve me in my career. After watching several documentaries and considering changing attitudes of employers toward higher education, I decided to drop out and focus on building valuable skills and experience. I don't regret this decision, as I am now debt-free and have the same skills as my peers who completed their undergrad.\nI want to be clear that I don't think all higher education is worthless. In fact, I'm considering going back to school to pursue a graduate degree in Mathematics. I hope you can understand my decision and give me a chance to prove that my lack of college degree doesn't reflect on my dedication, intelligence, ability, or potential. <br/><br/>\n\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this!\n"

    "body": "I'm a web developer with almost a decade of experience building SEO-friendly websites and responsive user interfaces. I specialize in using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, SCSS, and CSS in JS. I'm well-versed in modern CSS best practices, including grid, flexbox, and theme architecture using CSS variables. Additionally, I have extensive experience with server-side API design and consumption on a JAMstack architecture using full-stack web frameworks such as Next.js and Sveltekit. I've also built maintainable packages and processes in SalesForce Apex (Java). In terms of design, I have extensive experience in web and user interface design, and consistently achieve pixel-perfect design implementations.\n\nMy approach to work is guided by the principle of delivering value. Whenever I begin a task, I ask myself: how can I bring more value to the company and its clients? This mindset encourages me to think creatively and motivates me to go above and beyond in my work.\n",
