  "body": "County Line Construction was in need of a modernized online presence to enhance their brand equity and increase their business growth. Tasked with this mission, I undertook the responsibility of building their new website with two main goals in mind: (1) to establish a reputable brand identity and build trust with prospective customers, and (2) to generate new business through organic search. <br/>\n\nTo achieve these objectives, I embarked on a thorough market research to identify County Line's ideal customers and their unique pain points and desires. I condensed my findings into three comprehensive buyer personas that would serve as the foundation for crafting the brand identity assets. Employing a Story Brand template and a tone of voice chart, I guided future copywriting endeavors. I utilized Figma to develop a cohesive design system and employed Next JS and Tina CMS to construct and launch the new site.\n",
