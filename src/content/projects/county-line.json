	"body": "County Line Construction predominantly relied on word-of-mouth referrals as their main channel of generating new business. Because of this, I was contracted to build a new company website that would: (1) Build brand equity and trust with prospects, and (2) Generate new business from Google search. <br/>I started the project by conducting in-depth market research into County Lineâ€™s ideal customers in order to understand their pain points and deep desires. Then I condensed my research into three buyer personas that I would use to craft the brand identity assets. I created a Story Brand template and tone of voice chart to guide future copywriting. I used Figma to build out a consistent design system and developed the site using Next JS and Tina CMS.",
