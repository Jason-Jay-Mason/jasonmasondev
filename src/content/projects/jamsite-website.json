	"body": "I designed and built the company site for JamSite. I used a Story Brand to craft my messaging and decided to create a design that used a bit of a parody in order to help communicate technical ideas to non-technical audiences. I started the development by building the game in the hero using HTML canvas. I initially built a game AI using a neural network that I implemented from scratch but soon realized after some research that the idea was overkill, so I rolled back those changes and went with a simple decision tree. Then I built out the rest of the site using Sveltekit and Tailwind CSS. I implemented a custom scheduler that integrates with the Zoho API. ",
