  "body": "I designed and developed the website for JamSite, leveraging the power of Story Brand messaging to effectively communicate technical concepts to non-technical audiences. To add a touch of humor and whimsy, I opted for a slightly satirical design approach. For the development process, I started by incorporating an HTML canvas game in the hero section. Initially, I implemented a neural network-powered game AI from scratch, but soon realized that it was an overcomplication and opted for a more straightforward decision tree approach. Using Sveltekit and Tailwind CSS, I built out the remaining sections of the website, including a custom scheduler integrated with the Zoho API.",
