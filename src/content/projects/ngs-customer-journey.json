  "body": "Next Gear Solutions had been manually implementing digital campaigns with Pardot, but to optimize their return on ad spend, an automated customer journey delivering personalized messaging based on prospects' location in the buying process was needed. I was contracted to procure and implement a marketing automation solution.<br/>\n\nWhile Hubspot or SalesForce Marketing Cloud would have been ideal solutions because they could integrate natively with their CMS, SalesForce, budget constraints made Active Campaign a more feasible option. Over the course of six to nine months, I provided technical support on implementing campaigns that automated engagement-driven messaging and advertising. This included working with the Active Campaign development team to troubleshoot and debug their SalesForce package, developing SalesForce in Apex, and building custom solutions in PHP and Javascript.\n",
