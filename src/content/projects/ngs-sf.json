  "body": "I worked with the implementation team at Next Gear Solutions to build a customized solution that helped team members track the adoption of their products. This included the utilization of the SalesForce admin tool set such as Formula Fields, Flows, Workflow Rules, and Process Builder. In certain cases, I was required to use the SalesForce async API while writing custom Apex classes. My goal was to write code only when it was needed in order to reduce the amount of technical debt the company would need to deal with into the future.",
