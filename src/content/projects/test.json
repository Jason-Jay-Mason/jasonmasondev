	"body": "I was hired as a marketing manager at Terry Chiropractic to help implement a marketing plan that Dr. Terry had purchased. It entailed setting up direct sales events at local businesses where I was required to follow a sales script that was designed to bring qualified patients into the office. To my bewilderment, the pitch didn't work and was extremely pushy/unethical.<br/><br/>So my options were 1. Find a new job or 2. Figure out a way to ethically bring in new patients even though I had no marketing background. I prayed about it and decided to propose the idea of building a new website. I learned SEO, HTML, CSS, and a bit of javascript; and proceeded to build several websites for the business over the five years I was there.",
