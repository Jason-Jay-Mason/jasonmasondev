  "body": "For over three years, I worked on building websites for Terry Chiropractic that focused on obtaining and maintaining the top search result rankings on Google for the highest-converting keywords. When I first started the project, Terry Chiropractic's website was ranking on the second page and had a poor design. I conducted a comprehensive audit of all the competitors on the first page and sought inspiration from sites that were in more advanced markets like tech, law firms, etc. I synthesized the best ideas into a new design and then built, deployed, and migrated the site. Within a month, we started to see a trickle of new patients referred to us by the website for the first time despite little to no improvement in the rankings.<br/>\nObtaining the top search ranking required going beyond typical local SEO tactics at the time. After learning more about how the Google algorithm is constantly improving, I identified an opportunity in our market. I saw that most chiropractic offices were working with marketing agencies that were trying to game the algorithm by producing a high volume of keyword-packed content that offered little to no value. Because of this, I shifted my efforts toward producing content that our ideal customers actually found valuable and propagated it to all channels. Additionally, I implemented a strategy of gaining backlinks by exchanging value with other businesses in our area. We rapidly rose to the top rankings within a matter of months, and the trickle of new patients became a tsunami.\n",
