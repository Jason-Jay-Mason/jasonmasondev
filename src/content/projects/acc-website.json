  "body": "Upon my arrival at Accurence, it quickly became apparent that they were in dire need of a new website. In the tech industry, a company's website can make or break their brand equity. After undergoing a rebrand in 2018, we requested a portfolio of web development work from our contracted marketing agency to assess their abilities. Upon comparing their design and development quality to my own, the marketing director entrusted me with the task of designing and building the new site.<br/>\n\nUsing a hybrid implementation of a no-code page builder with custom components that I constructed, along with WordPress, I created a site that was both user-friendly and easily editable for content creators. This ensured that the website was not only fast but also met the needs of the marketing team's content requirements.\n",
