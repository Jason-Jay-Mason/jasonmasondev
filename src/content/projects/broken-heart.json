  "body": "Broken Heart Horse Farm approached me to develop a website for their high-end equestrian center. As a new business in the process of being established, I was contracted to provide a full range of brand assets, including a messaging guide and visual brand style guide, in addition to MarTech consulting and web development. The project requirements were extensive, including a fully customized, component-driven drag-and-drop page builder, a blog, horse sales content management, camp scheduling, and the implementation of a CRM with marketing automation.<br/>\n\nDue to the sheer number of items in scope, the team decided to use a CI/CD model instead of building the entire site upfront. I devised a timeline that would allow us to complete the project within six months. I began by designing the first set of features and components in Figma and proceeded to build the site using Next JS and Tina CMS. Unfortunately, shortly after the release of the second phase of features, the company encountered internal issues that led to their closure, and all work was abruptly halted. Nonetheless, the website was featured on the <a href='/tina-showcase.png' target='_blank'>official Tina CMS showcase</a> before the company's demise.",
